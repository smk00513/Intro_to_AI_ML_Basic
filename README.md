# Machine Learning with Real-World Datasets

## Overview
This project demonstrates core machine learning workflows using real-world datasets.
It includes examples of classification, regression, and unsupervised learning.

--

## Datasets
- Three publicly available datasets are used:
  - Classification dataset
  - Regression dataset
  - Unsupervised learning dataset (K-means)
- All datasets are included in this repository and are downloadable
- Dataset sizes are kept small for easy access and reproducibility

---

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and dataset splitting (train / validation / test)
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation on test data
- K-means clustering for unsupervised learning

---

## Results & Analysis
- Experimental results are summarized in Markdown format
- Model comparisons and observations are included
- Visualizations are provided where helpful
